/*
 * Problem : Check if the input string of braces contains matching opening and closing braces or not. 
 * 
 * Input : Array of strings containing values as "{[()]}" "}[]{", "{()[]", ...
 * Output : Array of strings containing result of braces match "YES" "NO"
 * 
 * Explanation : So in input "{[()]}" all the braces have matching close braces so the output will be "YES" but in second the closing brace is before an opening brace so output is "NO", similarly in third braces are not balanced so output is "NO"
